# ExtensionForChromeHours

Let me show you "My hours Worked,"  can registered  all your working hours automatically and easily, you only need to do a click when begin your job and at the end of it or when you make a parenthesis. All your hours you can export a CVS file anytime to bring a more detailed analysis of the same control. You can also write down the tasks you have to do to make you do not forget anything for that workday or mark them as done.

On the other side you have the chance to see so much graphical tasks using a pie chart, as the hours in a bar chart, which can be filtered by month and year in order to better appreciate the daily hours.
